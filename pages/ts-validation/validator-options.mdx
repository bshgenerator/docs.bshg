## Validator Options

The validator in this library provides customizable behavior through the `options` object, which can be passed during initialization in the `options` property of [`v.validator()`](/docs/library/validation/typescrip/v-validator).

### Available Options:

- **`dev?: boolean`**
- Enables debug mode when set to `true`. In debug mode, the validator logs detailed messages to the console to assist with troubleshooting.
- **Default Value:** `false`

- **`resultsType?: "array" | "object"`**
- Determines the structure used for storing nested validation results:
- `"array"`: Nested validation results are stored in arrays.
- `"object"`: Nested validation results are stored in objects.
- **Default Value:** `"object"`

<Callout type="warning">
    <em>Note:</em> The <code>resultsType</code> option has been added to support projects using multiple programming languages (not just TypeScript). It may be removed in future versions once other language versions (such as Java) are stabilized.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
    <em>Recommendation:</em> If you are working exclusively with TypeScript, we recommend using <code>"object"</code> for <code>resultsType</code>.
